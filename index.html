                <div id="about-me" style="display:none;">
                    <p>
                        I lived in a lot of different countries. These countries are quite varied
                        and include Vietnam, Indonesia, America, New Zealand, Malaysia and the UK. I think my
                        international background has largely shaped my personality as it has meant that I've
                        had exposure to a lot of different cultures and environments.
                        <br><br>I'm currently studying Computer Systems Engineering as I've always had an interest in
                        seeing how things were created, especially in the digital area. I'm hoping that through my
                        degree, I will have the potential to work in an area where I can make a difference. I am also
                        currently working at Gentrack as a Software Engineer.
                        <br><br>My interests outside of my career and studies include rock climbing, travelling and
                        playing board games. These interests have led me to become president of the rock climbing
                        club where I'm an assessor and instructor, and organize trips and events for our members.

                <h3>Software Engineering Intern, Gentrack (Novemeber 2018 - Current)</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently working in a team of five, and have worked on different aspects such as
                    our CI pipeline, a logging SDK, and
                    infrastructure for some of our reoccuring tasks.
                    <br>As an intern, I've had exposure using modern tooling such as Go, Typescript, AWS, Docker and
                    Terraform
                    <br>
                    <br>Over the summer, I worked in a team of three interns, where we developed a pipeline to collect
                    metrics on Gentrack products. This involved building a client-side collector in Python which sent
                    local information to our Elasticsearch and Kibana servers in AWS. Our AWS resources were generated
                    automatically through Cloudformation, in an Infrastructure as Code architecture.
